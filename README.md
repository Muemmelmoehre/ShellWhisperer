# ShellWhisperer - interactive cheatsheet for shell/tty one-liners

It's a tiny python script printing a one-liner that allows you to spawn a shell. Specify the language of your one-liner or the programm from which you'd like to spawn a shell as argument.

Run it with: python3 shw.py \<lang\>

Supported languages and programs so far: bash, nano, perl, python, ruby and vim. More are yet to come. Stay tuned!

Special thanks to @fin5tern15 for helping me out with a few questions on argparse!
